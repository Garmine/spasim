spasim
==========

spasim (spring of 1974) was the first massively multiplayer first person shooter 3D game.
After nearly 40 years, spasim is being rebooted.[ spasim.org]

The original spasim introduced not only the idea of a shared 3D universe within a computer game, but also the idea of nonterrestrial resources to the "Limits to Growth" zeitgeist of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The spasim reboot introduces a new multi-core real-time ray tracer.

spasim is to be a perfect monstrous hybrid of sl/opensim, minecraft, and the underbelly of irc; this hopeful monster will subsume the web as it deals the fatal blow to rasterization.

spasim: the first virtual world; and now perhaps the last.
